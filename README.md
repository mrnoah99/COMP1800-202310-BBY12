Project Name: GameSavvy

Our team seeks to provide gamers with a reliable and user-friendly application for accessing sources of gaming news and recommendations with the help of ChatGPT technology, aiming to address their gaming-related needs in an efficient manner.

We've used frontend, backend, and database technologies in this webapp, and used ChatGPT to help us to develop it.

A visualisation of the file system is too long, so I cannot show it.

In order to contribute to this project, you would need:
    -Visual Studio code or Brackets
    -Node.js
    -Studio3T for MongoDB
    -Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB
    -The Node packages listed in package.json
    The order of installation does not matter, except for Node. Node must be installed in order to run the package manager for installation of its packages.

    The connection key for MongoDB is stored in a .env file that is not hosted on the GitHub, so you will need to request that from an existing member of the team.

    There aren't any admin logins for our app, but a passwords.txt will be shared that contains some test account information, should you need it.

Our app is designed to allow users to get information about games, recommendations based on their preferences, code for free games during events, and discuss with their communities, all in one convenient location.

This project had one main criteria: Use AI in some form during development.
So we did just that. Using ChatGPT, Seung-yeop, Eddie, and Sohee were able to debug on their own with more complicated errors, allowing Noah to get the more advanced stuff done. Noah also used ChatGPT, but only to help him to load the datasets' information correctly.
